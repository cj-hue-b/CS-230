Portfolio Submission
The Gaming Room was the client for this project, and they sought a cross‑platform application to support their game Draw It or Lose It. Their requirements emphasized scalability, uniqueness of game instances, and compatibility across different operating platforms. The system needed to manage multiple teams, players, and sessions simultaneously, while ensuring efficient resource use and a smooth user experience.

In developing the design documentation, one of the things I did particularly well was organizing the material clearly and professionally. I broke down complex requirements into modular sections, used UML diagrams to visualize relationships, and explained design choices in a way that was accessible to both technical and nontechnical readers. This clarity made the document not only a blueprint for coding but also a communication tool for stakeholders.

Working through the design document was especially helpful when it came time to develop the code. By mapping out classes, responsibilities, and interactions in advance, I avoided redundancy and clarified how to enforce rules such as ensuring unique game instances. This upfront planning reduced debugging later and gave me confidence that the architecture would support future scalability.

If I could revise one part of my work, I would revisit the section comparing operating platforms. While I covered the basics of Windows, Mac, Linux, and mobile environments, I could have added more detail about deployment strategies and performance trade‑offs. Expanding that section would make the document more useful for long‑term planning and system evolution.

Interpreting the user’s needs was central to the design. I focused on scalability, uniqueness, and usability by implementing design patterns such as Singleton to ensure only one instance of a game exists at a time, and modular classes to allow easy expansion for future features. Considering user needs is critical because software must solve real problems for its audience; ignoring them leads to wasted effort and poor adoption.
